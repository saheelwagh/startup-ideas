# Simple list of practical projects

The idea behind this list is to collect project ideas that I beleieve are :

1. Too simple to be monetizable
2. Involve essential skills to learn for a startup developer
3. Can be easily learnt/implemented by beginners

Most of these projects will not be mine. being simple, those are likely to have tutorials all over the web. My goal is to simply collect and store in one place the projects that I find necessary to learn to make.
